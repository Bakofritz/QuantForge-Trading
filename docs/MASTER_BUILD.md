# QuantForge Master Build

## Operating rule

This repository is maintained as a cumulative master build. Iterations are incremental and recorded here instead of producing redundant document families.

## v26.41 — Clean GitHub Directory Overhaul
- Converted the repository into explicit source, test, research, docs, tools, release, and CI boundaries.
- Preserved v26.35 artifacts as immutable release evidence.
- Added the native QuantForge.Core project boundary and fail-closed research contracts.
- Added architecture tests and a static repository gate.
- Native .NET compilation remains unverified locally because no .NET SDK is installed in the build environment.

## v26.42 — Data/Strategy Admission Hardening
- Added canonical research-manifest serialization and validation.
- Added explicit user-selectable strategy feature categories.
- Added immutable provenance-record contract connecting original and sanitized artifact fingerprints to a scrub report.
- Research manifests cannot represent LiveAccount authority.
- Research feature selection rejects order submission, application-setting mutation, and unreviewed process/native-library execution.
- Added regression tests for manifest round-trip, live-authority rejection, and feature selection.

## v26.43 — Deterministic Research Execution Skeleton
- Added validated market-event contract.
- Added research-only simulation intent contract with causal earliest-fill constraint.
- Added isolated ledger namespace and ledger-evidence contracts.
- Added multi-strategy research-batch identity validation with duplicate strategy rejection.
- Added regression coverage for OHLC integrity, causal fill timing, and multi-strategy isolation.
- No broker or live-account adapter was added.

## v26.44 — Deterministic Fill + Evidence Layer
- Added deterministic next-eligible-event fill model.
- Added explicit per-unit commission and slippage inputs.
- Added append-only SHA-256 evidence-chain contract.
- Added regression tests for deterministic fill arithmetic and evidence-chain divergence.
- No live order route or broker integration was introduced.

## v26.45 — Native Build Stabilization + Simulated Account/Reporting Foundation
- Rebased the v26.45 working branch onto the confirmed v26.44 source baseline after detecting that main did not yet contain v26.41–v26.44.
- Corrected the native test-project compile failure by adding the explicit xUnit global using required by the test sources.
- Preserved the research-only authority boundary.
- Extended SimulationFill identity to retain buy/sell side so account-state semantics cannot infer direction from quantity.
- Added isolated simulated-account state with cash, long position, average entry price, realized P&L, unrealized P&L, and equity snapshots.
- Added reproducible research-report contract with explicit Complete, DataBlocked, and Invalid states.
- Data-blocked and invalid reports cannot carry simulated performance state.
- Added regression tests for account P&L, ledger isolation, and report blocking semantics.

### Validation status
- Source-level review: completed.
- Native .NET validation: submitted to GitHub Actions after this commit; final pass/fail must be taken from the actual workflow result.
- Local native compilation is not claimed.
- No trading performance numbers were generated.
- No live broker or live-account path was introduced.

## Build governance / approval workflow
- Mellon initiates one controlled master-build inspection/planning cycle.
- The authoritative repository is Bakofritz/QuantForge-Trading.
- Each iteration starts by reviewing the last confirmed stable repository source and checking repository integrity.
- Planned build contents, affected paths, baseline SHA, branch, intended commit, and validation plan are presented before packaging or repository changes.
- The build remains queued until the user explicitly approves the exact proposal.
- Material changes to an approved proposal require a new approval.
- A successful scrub, simulation, replay, optimization, or research approval never grants LiveAccount authority.
- ZIP packaging is performed only after the approved repository state and commit are confirmed.
- Cumulative documentation is appended to running files rather than generating redundant documentation families.

## Next stability targets
- Connect the simulated account to a deterministic execution/research runner rather than exposing it as a standalone contract.
- Expand position accounting beyond long-only semantics where explicitly required by the approved design.
- Add canonical report serialization and result-package fingerprints.
- Add richer data-coverage/block-reason contracts.
- Continue toward native Android/Windows application integration only after the core research contracts remain green.

## Progress estimate after v26.45
- Core research/simulation: 88%
- Safety/governance: 93%
- Strategy quarantine/scrubbing/import: 86%
- Historical-data integrity/provenance: 87%
- Read-only multi-strategy research: 84%
- Optimization/research admission: 80%
- Native Android/Windows production: 45–50%
- Full end-to-end implementation: 69–72%
- Overall usable research platform: 82–85%

These are engineering planning estimates, not runtime certification.
